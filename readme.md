This is a repository of scripts used to parse FileMaker fields and export data to DarwinCore standards. They are being shared here to give examples and help other collection managers update their workflows to include DarwinCore and share their data online. These are specific to datasets used in the Vertebrate Paleontology collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences but can be adapted for many collections. 

For more information on DarwinCore see http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm
For more information about the Vertebrate Paleontology collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences, see my repository on our workflows and database standards

More scripts will be added as I finish my co-op.
